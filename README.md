This repository presents the codes to simulate least mean square (LMS) and recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive channel equalization schemes 
applied to single-input single-output (SISO) orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM) communication systems.

Use termProjectOFDM.m code to simulate the system model.

LMSeq and RLSeq present LMS and RLS equalization schemes.

The rest of the files are simulation results represented in project report, which can be plotted using figures.m
